  Patches should be sent for review to Kevin Ottens <ervin@kde.org> before
  being committed to Git. If major user interface changes are being
  made, a screenshot of what the application looks like after the change
  should be sent along with the patch.

* Design

  Model Layer:
  ------------
  The application is built around a set of item models and views. GlobalModel
  is a singleton in charge of creating all the models used in the application.

  - At the there's TodoFlatModel, which lists all the todo contained in a
    resource.
  - Above it there's TodoTreeModel, which exposes a tree of todo based on their
    relateToUid property.
  - There's also TodoCategoriesModel, which exposes a tree of todo based on
    their categories (a todo can have several categories, then it appears
    several times in the tree).
  - ProjectsModel and ContextsModel expose only the non-todo subset of the two
    previous models.
  - LibraryModel which wraps a model and add two entries to it: Inbox and
    Library (Inbox is empty, and Library contains the source model).

  So inside GlobalModel the link between models is the following:

              tree model --------- projects model --- library model
             /
            /
  flat model
            \
             \
              categories model --- contexts model --- library model


  View Layer:
  -----------
  Also we have a special model to show action lists, this model should be
  considered as being part of the view layer since it has no other feature
  than ensuring a proper layout of our lists. It can be used on top of:
    - TodoFlatModel
    - TodoTreeModel
    - TodoCategoriesModel

  This model works along with with ActionListView and ActionListDelegate to
  visually obtain a nice action list with sections. It is part of the central
  view.

  The mainwindow is split into a sidebar and the action list editor. They both
  provide the actions you can use with them.

  - SideBar allows to display the contexts LibraryModel or the projects
    LibraryModel depending on which mode the application is on.
  - ActionListEditor allows to display action lists and add (or remove) items
    to them.
